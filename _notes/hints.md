> The training data was collected by recording the actions of a human driver together with the video data. The human driver remotely drives the robot straight ahead until the robot encounters a non-traversible obstacle. The human driver then avoids the obstacle by steering the robot in the appropriate direction. The learning system is trained in supervised mode. It takes a single pair of heavily-subsampled images from the two cameras, and is trained to predict the steering angle produced by the human driver at that time.[1]

**Data collection strategy**

> The general strategy for collecting training data was as follows: (a) Collecting data from as large a variety of off-road training grounds as possible. Data was collected from a large number of parks, playgrounds, frontyards and backyards of a number of suburban homes, and heavily clut- tered construction areas; (b) Collecting data with various lighting conditions, i. e., different weather conditions and different times of day; (c) Collecting sequences where the vehicle starts driving straight and then is steered left or right as the robot approached an obstacle; (d) Avoiding turns when no obstacles were present; (e) Including straight runs with no ob- stacles and no turns as part of the training set; (f) Trying to be consistent in the turning behavior, i. e., always turning at approximately the same distance from an obstacle.[1]
